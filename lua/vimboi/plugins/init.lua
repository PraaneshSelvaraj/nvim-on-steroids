-- plugins/init.lua — I am high... on plugins. Code go brrrr. Sanity? Never heard of her.

return {
  require("vimboi.plugins.telescope"), -- fuzzy finders because remembering file names is hard okay
  require("vimboi.plugins.neo-tree"), -- file tree for when you're too lazy to remember your own directory structure
  -- slap your other plugins below like it's a to-do list you'll never finish
}
